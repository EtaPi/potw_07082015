This one is less of a Problem, and more just trying something new. Pick a new language that you've never used before, and write a simple program. Some ideas:

  * A todo app- a command line app with three options; todo, which creates a new todo, list, which lists all your current todos, and remove, which deletes a todo.
  * Algorithms- implement Factorial and Fibonacci. See if the language supports things like memoization and recursion.
  * Search/Count- Reads in files in the current directory, searches for a string, and prints out instances of the string or the total count.
  * Anything you want!
 
Capabilities to focus on are string, number, or array manipulation, as well as file IO. Keep it simple and explore something new!
